# Boechera-RNASeq-2019
This contains scripts created for analysis of my Master's thesis at SDSU, titled "RNA-Seq Analysis of the Heat Stress Response in Two Boechera Species."

There are several places in these scripts that could be automated with a loop or array.  However, due to contraints from the server running the scripts, they are separated into individual steps.  This way, I could easily run a subset of the commands.
